Putting everything together, Cordova App with Azure Mobile App
======================
In this module, we will be putting all the pieces together. We will be consuming the Mobile App API that we created in Module 1 and will be extending the Cordova App knowledge we learned in Module 2.

**Steps**
To follow along this module, you will need Ionic and Cordova npm packages installed and you will need a text editor of your choice. (Visual Studio Code, Full Visual Studio, Atom, Sublime)
